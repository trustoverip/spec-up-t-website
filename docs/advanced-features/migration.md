# Migrate from Spec-Up

:::info
Go straight to the [migration instructions](https://github.com/trustoverip/spec-up-migrate/blob/main/README.md#-commands).
:::


**Pre condition: You have a Spec-Up installation up and running**

## When do you need this?

You will need the instructions below if you have a **Spec-Up** installation and want to convert it to **Spec-Up-T**.

## Why would you want this?

Spec-Up-T has more features than Spec-Up.

## What you'll need

- A terminal / command line
- An editor, also called IDE (Integrated Development Environment). We recommend Visual Studio Code, but an editor in which you can quickly write Markdown is also good
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies
  - Use Node.js version 18 or higher
  - If you are running a Spec-Up installation you already have Node.js installed
- A [webbrowser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). You are probably reading this in a browser, so you already have one
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/). To host your specification on Github, you must also have Git installed on your local system. By the way, you can also create a specification (index.html) without hosting it on GitHub. But if you do so, the whole idea of a version-managed glossary using Git goes through the window.

:::note Non-technical Info

Non-technical explanation:

- Command Line: A text interface to type commands for your computer.
- IDE: A software where you can easily write, test, and debug code.
- Node.js: This makes Spec-Up and Spec-Up-T run
- Git: A system to track and manage changes in your code.

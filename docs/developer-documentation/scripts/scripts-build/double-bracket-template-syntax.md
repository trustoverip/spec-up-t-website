This document provides comprehensive documentation for the terminology templates and specification references used in Spec-Up-T, an enhanced version of Spec-Up that adds terminology tooling capabilities.

## Overview

Spec-Up-T uses a double-bracket template syntax `[[template-type:arguments]]` to handle term definitions, references, and cross-specification linking. These templates are processed during the markdown-to-HTML conversion and enable sophisticated terminology management across multiple specifications.

## Terminology Templates

### 1. Definition Template: `[[def:term]]`

**Purpose**: Defines a new term and creates an anchor for referencing.

**Syntax**:

```markdown
[[def: primary-term, synonym1, synonym2, ...]]
```

**Description**:

- Creates a definition term with multiple synonyms
- Generates HTML anchor IDs for each synonym
- Must be the first line of a term definition file
- Followed by the definition content using `~` prefix

**Example**:

```markdown
[[def: term 1, term one, Term One]]

~ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. This is the definition of the term.

~ Additional paragraphs of the definition can be added with ~ prefix.
```

**Rendered Output**:

- Creates `<span id="term:term-1">`, `<span id="term:term-one">`, `<span id="term:term-one">` anchors
- Generates proper HTML definition list structure
- All synonyms become searchable and referenceable

**Implementation Details**:

- Spaces in terms are converted to hyphens and lowercased for IDs
- The primary term (first one) is used as the display name
- All synonyms are indexed and can be referenced

### 2. Reference Template: `[[ref:term]]`

**Purpose**: Creates a clickable link to a locally defined term.

**Syntax**:

```markdown
[[ref: term-name]]
```

**Description**:

- Links to terms defined within the same specification
- Case-insensitive matching
- Generates internal anchor links

**Example**:

```markdown
This concept relates to [[ref: term 1]] and [[ref: Term Two]].
```

**Rendered Output**:

```html
<a class="term-reference" href="#term:term-1">term 1</a>
<a class="term-reference" href="#term:term-two">Term Two</a>
```

**Features**:

- Automatic validation of reference targets
- Warns about unresolved references during build
- Supports all synonyms defined in `[[def:]]` tags

### 3. External Reference Template: `[[xref:spec,term]]`

**Purpose**: Creates a link to a term defined in an external specification.

**Syntax**:

```markdown
[[xref: external-spec-name, term-name]]
```

**Description**:

- Links to terms in other specifications
- Requires external specification to be configured in `specs.json`
- Opens in external site when clicked

**Example**:

```markdown
See the [[xref: test-1, authentication]] concept in the external specification.
```

**Configuration Required**:

External specifications must be defined in `specs.json`:

```json
{
  "specs": [
    {
      "external_specs": [
        {
          "external_spec": "test-1",
          "path": "https://github.com/org/repo",
          "gh_page": "https://example.github.io/spec-1/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rendered Output**:

```html
<a class="x-term-reference term-reference" 
   data-local-href="#term:test-1:authentication"
   href="https://example.github.io/spec-1/#term:authentication">
   authentication
</a>
```

**Features**:

- Dual-mode linking (local and external) via `data-local-href` and `href` attributes
- Fallback to '#' if external spec not configured
- Validation during build process
- Tooltip support with `data-term-content` when external definitions are available
- CSS classes: `x-term-reference term-reference` for styling

### 4. Transcluded Reference Template: `[[tref:spec,term,alias1,alias2,...]]`

**Purpose**: Embeds the full definition of a term from an external specification.

**Syntax**:

```markdown
[[tref: external-spec-name, term-name]]
[[tref: external-spec-name, term-name, alias1]]
[[tref: external-spec-name, term-name, alias1, alias2, ...]]
```

**Description**:

- Fetches and displays the complete definition from external repository
- Creates a collapsible definition section
- Shows metadata about the source (repository, commit hash, etc.)
- Must be used as the first line of a term definition file
- Supports multiple aliases (comma-separated after the term name)

**Example**:

```markdown
[[tref: test-1, digital-signature]]
[[tref: test-1, digital-signature, signature, sig]]
```

**File Structure**:

- Each `[[tref:]]` should be in its own `.md` file
- File should contain only the tref tag (no additional content)
- Placed in the `terms-definitions` directory

**Rendered Output**:

- Creates a definition term with transcluded content
- Includes metadata table showing source repository information
- Content is fetched from external GitHub repositories
- Supports collapsible/expandable interface

**Technical Implementation**:

- Fetches latest commit hash from external repository
- Caches content locally for performance
- Validates external specification configuration
- Handles missing terms gracefully

**Features**:

- Real-time content from external sources
- Metadata tracking (owner, repo, commit hash)
- Collapsible interface for better UX
- Error handling for missing terms

### 5. File Inclusion Template: `[[insert:file.txt]]` (Not Currently Implemented)

:::warning
**Status**: This template is mentioned in test files and regex patterns but is **not currently implemented** in the template-tag parser. It exists as placeholder functionality that may be added in future versions.
:::

**Purpose**: Would include the content of another file directly into the current document.

**Planned Syntax**:

```markdown
[[insert: path/to/file.txt]]
```

**Note**: While this syntax appears in test files and is recognized by regex patterns, attempting to use it will not produce the expected file inclusion behavior.

## Additional Template Features

### Table-defined Terms

Terms can also be defined within table structures for attribute-based definitions:

```markdown
Variable            | Default Value  | Max Value
------------------- | -------------  | ---------
[[def: Variable 1]] | 123            | 9999
```

**Features**:

- First column definitions automatically create term anchors
- Hovering shows tooltip with entire row context
- Useful for parameter/configuration documentation

## Specification References

### 1. Specification Reference: `[[spec:name]]`

**Purpose**: References a complete specification document.

**Syntax**:

```markdown
[[spec: specification-name]]
```

**Description**:

- Creates a formal reference to an entire specification
- Used in bibliography or reference sections
- Links to the specification's main page
- Implemented in separate `spec-parser.js` module
- Supports grouped references like `[[spec-normative:]]` and `[[spec-informative:]]`

**Example**:

```markdown
This document follows the guidelines outlined in [[spec: RFC-3986]].
```

**Features**:

- Formal citation formatting with `[RFC-3986]` style links
- Automatic link generation with `#ref:` anchors
- Bibliography integration and grouping
- Normalizes specification names (uppercase with hyphens)

### 2. Draft Specification Reference: `[[spec-draft:name]]`

**Purpose**: References a draft or work-in-progress specification.

**Syntax**:

```markdown
[[spec-draft: specification-name]]
```

**Description**:

- Similar to `[[spec:]]` but indicates draft status
- Often used for referencing specifications under development
- May include different styling to indicate draft status

**Example**:

```markdown
The proposed changes are detailed in [[spec-draft: new-authentication-protocol]].
```

## Configuration and Setup

### External Specifications Configuration

External specifications must be configured in the `specs.json` file:

```json
{
  "specs": [
    {
      "external_specs": [
        {
          "external_spec": "short-name",
          "path": "https://github.com/organization/spec-name",
          "gh_page": "https://organization.github.io/spec-name/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Configuration Fields**:

- `external_spec`: Short identifier used in templates
- `path`: GitHub repository URL
- `gh_page`: URL to the published specification

### Term Definition File Structure

Term definition files follow a specific structure:

```markdown
[[def: primary-term, synonym1, synonym2]]

~ First paragraph of definition with ~ prefix.

~ Additional paragraphs also with ~ prefix.

~ Cross-references: [[ref: other-term]], [[xref: external-spec, external-term]]
```

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Pre-processing**: Escape mechanism handles literal template syntax with backslash
2. **Template Processing**: Templates are converted to HTML using markdown-it extensions
3. **Markdown Rendering**: Standard markdown processing with custom plugins
4. **Post-processing**: Definition list structure fixes and sorting
5. **External Content**: Transcluded content is fetched and inserted client-side

## Error Handling and Validation

### Validation Features

- **Reference Validation**: Checks for unresolved `[[ref:]]` links
- **External Spec Validation**: Verifies external specification configuration
- **Term Existence Validation**: Confirms transcluded terms exist in external repositories
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health check system for terminology integrity

### Common Error Messages

- "Unresolved References": Terms referenced but not defined
- "Dangling Definitions": Terms defined but never referenced
- "Invalid external spec reference": External specification not configured
- "Term not found in external repository": Transcluded term doesn't exist

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use lowercase with hyphens for term IDs
   - Provide meaningful synonyms in `[[def:]]` tags
   - Keep external spec names short and descriptive

2. **File Organization**:
   - One term per file in `terms-definitions` directory
   - Use descriptive filenames matching the primary term
   - Group related terms in subdirectories if needed

3. **Cross-References**:
   - Use `[[ref:]]` for internal terms
   - Use `[[xref:]]` for external terms you want to link to
   - Use `[[tref:]]` for external terms you want to embed

4. **External Specifications**:
   - Always configure external specs in `specs.json`
   - Use `path` for repository URLs and `gh_page` for published URLs

5. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Start definition content with `~` prefix
   - Use consistent formatting across all terms
   - Include relevant cross-references in definitions

6. **File Organization Notes**:
   - Term files are automatically detected and indexed (no manual configuration needed)
   - Files are processed in alphabetical order by default
   - Use descriptive filenames that match primary terms

## Advanced Features

### Escape Mechanism

To display literal template syntax without processing, use a backslash before the opening brackets:

```markdown
Use \[[def: literal-example]] to show the syntax literally.
Use \[[xref: spec, term]] to display xref syntax.
Use \[[tref: spec, term]] to display tref syntax.
```

**Supported Tag Types**: All template types support escaping: `def`, `ref`, `xref`, `tref`, `spec`, `insert`

### Automatic Term Detection

- Term files are automatically discovered in the `terms-definitions` directory
- No manual configuration required (unlike original Spec-Up)
- Files are indexed and processed automatically during build

### Performance Optimizations

- Client-side rendering for transcluded content
- Caching of external repository data
- Batch DOM updates for better rendering performance
- Lazy loading of complex definitions

### Health Check System

Built-in validation system that checks for:

- Unresolved `[[ref:]]` references
- Missing external specification configurations
- Invalid `[[tref:]]` targets
- Dangling definitions (defined but never referenced)

### Cognitive Complexity Management

The system is designed to keep cognitive complexity below 15 for maintainability and follows SonarQube analysis standards.

### Advanced Performance Features

- Client-side rendering for transcluded content
- Batch DOM updates for better rendering performance
- Caching of external content
- Lazy loading of transcluded definitions

This documentation covers the complete template syntax system used in Spec-Up-T for terminology management and cross-specification linking. The system provides a powerful yet simple way to maintain consistent terminology across multiple related specifications.

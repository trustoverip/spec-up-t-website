# Introduction

Spec-Up-T offers three primary methods for working with your specifications:

- **Command line (local):** Install and operate Spec-Up-T on your local machine using the command line.
- **GitHub web-based:** Use GitHub Actions to run Spec-Up-T workflows directly in your browser, and edit files using GitHub's built-in web editor.
- **Spec-Up-T Editor:** Use the dedicated web-based Spec-Up-T Editor application for a streamlined editing experience with advanced features.

## Command Line (Local Installation)

Running Spec-Up-T locally provides the fastest execution and greatest control. Once installed, you can launch the interactive menu and work with all features offline. This method is ideal for developers and power users who are comfortable with the command line.

## GitHub Web-Based

The GitHub web-based approach uses GitHub Actions to run Spec-Up-T workflows directly on GitHub's servers, making it ideal for those seeking a quick setup without installing anything locally. However, this method initiates a "Runner" on GitHub's servers, which can take several minutes to provision and execute the necessary code. As a result, the overall process may be slower compared to local installation.

Editing files can be done directly through GitHub's built-in web editor when you navigate to a file and click the edit button.

## Spec-Up-T Editor

The Spec-Up-T Editor is a dedicated web-based application that provides an intuitive interface for editing and managing specification files stored in GitHub repositories. It offers advanced features like:

- Visual file management with drag-and-drop reordering
- Integrated markdown editor with preview
- External specifications management
- Health check diagnostics
- Terms and definitions management

This method combines the convenience of web-based editing with specialized tools designed specifically for specification development. See the [Spec-Up-T Editor User Guide](/docs/spec-up-t-editor/spec-up-t-editor-user-guide) for complete documentation.

# Introduction

Spec-Up-T offers **three distinct methods** for creating and editing your specifications. Each method has different strengths, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs and technical comfort level.

## The Three Methods

### 1. Local Installation (Command Line)

Install Spec-Up-T on your computer and work locally using the command line.

**Best for:**
- Developers and technical users
- Fast, responsive editing and rendering
- Offline work
- Full control over the development environment

**You'll need:**
- Node.js and Git installed on your computer
- Familiarity with command line tools
- A local text editor (like Visual Studio Code)

### 2. GitHub Web-Based

Use GitHub Actions to run Spec-Up-T workflows and GitHub's built-in web editor for editing files - all through your web browser.

**Best for:**
- Quick setup without installing software
- Occasional contributors
- Simple edits and updates
- Users who prefer browser-based work

**You'll need:**
- A GitHub account
- A web browser
- Basic familiarity with GitHub's interface

**Note:** GitHub Actions run on GitHub's servers, which can take several minutes to start up and execute.

### 3. Spec-Up-T Editor

Use our dedicated web-based Spec-Up-T Editor application - a specialized tool designed specifically for specification development.

**Best for:**
- Content authors who want an intuitive interface
- Visual file organization (drag-and-drop)
- Managing external specification references
- Teams needing health checks and diagnostics
- Users who want more features than GitHub's basic editor

**You'll need:**
- A GitHub account
- A web browser
- A GitHub Personal Access Token (we'll show you how)

**Key features:**
- Visual file management with drag-and-drop reordering
- Integrated markdown editor with live preview
- External specifications management
- Health check diagnostics
- Terms and definitions management

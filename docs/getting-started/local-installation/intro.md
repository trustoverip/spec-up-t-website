# Local Installation Overview

## What is Local Installation?

Local Installation means installing Spec-Up-T directly on your computer and running it via the command line. This is the most powerful and fastest way to work with Spec-Up-T, giving you complete control over your development environment.

## How It Works

With local installation, you:

1. **Install Node.js and Git** on your computer (if not already installed)
2. **Clone or create** a Spec-Up-T repository on your local machine
3. **Use command line tools** to run Spec-Up-T commands
4. **Edit files** using your preferred text editor (like Visual Studio Code)
5. **Push changes** to GitHub when ready to share or publish

## Interactive Command Line Menu

Once installed, Spec-Up-T provides an interactive menu - you don't need to memorize commands! Simply run:

```bash
npm run menu
```

This presents a numbered menu where you can:
- Render your specification
- Generate PDFs and DOCX files
- Collect external references
- Run health checks
- And more

## Two Ways to Get Started

### Option 1: Clone an Existing Repository

If you're joining an existing Spec-Up-T project:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start working immediately

### Option 2: Install from Scratch

If you're creating a new specification project:

- Install Spec-Up-T on your local machine using `npx`
- Configure your new project
- Begin writing your specification

# Requirements

## Introduction

To successfully run **Spec-Up-T**, ensure your system meets the following requirements:


## Tools

- A **terminal / Command Line**. This is a standard tool on Windows, macOS and Linux.
- An **editor**, also called IDE (Integrated Development Environment). We recommend Visual Studio Code, but an editor in which you can quickly write Markdown is also good
  - Download VS Code from [the VS Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A [**webbrowser**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). You are probably reading this in a browser, so you already have one
- **Git**. To host your specification on Github, you must also have Git installed on your local system. By the way, you can also create a specification (index.html) without hosting it on GitHub. But if you do so, the whole idea of a version-managed glossary using Git goes through the window.
  - Download Git from [the Git official website](https://git-scm.com/).

## System requirements

1. **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS Monterey or later, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended).
2. **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later.
   - Node.js versions: Even-numbered versions (e.g., 18, 20, 22) are LTS (Long-Term Support) versions, which are stable and recommended for production. Odd-numbered versions (e.g., 19, 21, 23) are current releases with the latest features but may include experimental changes.
   - Current production version (as of September 18, 2025): 22.19.0
   - Verify installation: `node -v`
   - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies
   - [Installing instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
3. **npm**: Version 7.x or later (bundled with Node.js).
   - Verify installation: `npm -v`
4. **Internet Connection**: Required to fetch dependencies from the npm registry.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure the system time is synchronized for HTTPS and certificate validation.

# GitHub Web-Based Introduction

## What is the GitHub Web-Based Method?

The GitHub Web-Based method allows you to work with Spec-Up-T entirely through your web browser, without installing any software on your computer. This method combines two GitHub features:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows that run Spec-Up-T commands (like rendering, PDF generation) on GitHub's servers
2. **GitHub's Web Editor**: GitHub's built-in file editor for making changes to your markdown files directly in your browser

## No Installation Required

With this method, you don't need to install Node.js, Git, or any command line tools on your computer. Everything runs in your browser and on GitHub's servers!

## How It Works

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- **Create a New Spec-Up-T Installation** from a template
- Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository
- Use the **"Menu" Workflow** under "Run workflow" to:
  - Render your specification
  - Generate PDFs
  - Update files
  - And more - all with a few clicks

### Editing Files with GitHub's Web Editor

To edit any file in your repository:

1. Navigate to the file in GitHub
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right
3. Make your changes in the browser-based editor
4. Scroll down and commit your changes with a message

## Important: This is Different from the Spec-Up-T Editor

:::warning
**Don't confuse these two web-based options:**

- **GitHub Web-Based** (this section): Uses GitHub's standard web editor and GitHub Actions
- **[Spec-Up-T Editor](../spec-up-t-editor/intro.md)**: A separate, specialized web application with advanced features - 🌐 **[Launch it here](https://blockchainbird.org/spec-up-t-web-editor/)**

Both work in your browser, but the Spec-Up-T Editor offers more sophisticated editing tools.

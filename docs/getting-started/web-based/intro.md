# Introduction

## No installation

With Spec-Up-T, you don't need to install Node.js, Git, or any tools on your computer — everything can run in your browser using GitHub Actions! Whether you're creating a new specification project or managing an existing one, our workflows let you do it all online. Here's how it works:

- **Create a New Spec-Up-T Installation**
- Go to the repository you just created
- **"Menu" Workflow**
- Use GitHub Actions workflows under "Run workflow" to run scripts like rendering your specification, generating a PDF, or updating files—all with a few clicks.

There are no downloads or command lines—just a GitHub account and a browser. Dive in and start specifying the easy way!

:::tip
For file editing, you have two options:
1. **GitHub's built-in editor**: Click on any file in GitHub and use the pencil icon to edit directly in your browser
2. **Spec-Up-T Editor**: Use the dedicated [Spec-Up-T Editor](/docs/spec-up-t-editor/spec-up-t-editor-user-guide) for advanced features like drag-and-drop file ordering, external specifications management, and health checks

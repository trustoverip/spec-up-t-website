# Overview

**Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span>** is a technical specification and standardization tool, which a special focus on terminology. It helps you write content in the form of specifications and glossaries.

The two parts content and term definitions also illustrate the two main use cases of Spec-Up-T:

- a glossary (fat terms section, slim content section)
- a standardization specification (slim terms section, fat content section)

**Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span>** is a tool for writing in Markdown files and creates *one* `index.html` file from all these Markdown files.

- You write your texts in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), "the simple and easy-to-use markup language"
- You can edit files using:
  1. **A local editor (IDE)** like Visual Studio Code on your computer
  2. **GitHub's web editor** by clicking the edit button on any file in GitHub
  3. **The Spec-Up-T Editor** - a dedicated web application with advanced features ([launch](https://blockchainbird.org/spec-up-t-web-editor/) | [learn more](/docs/getting-started/spec-up-t-editor/user-guide))
- Your Markdown files are converted to one `index.html` file
- The place where your Markdown files and the `index.html` are stored is [GitHub](https://github.com)

The endproduct of your work is **the `index.html` file, the actual specification file.**

This `index.html` file is stand-alone and can be hosted on any web server. Or double-click it, and it will open in a browser. The most common place is a GitHub Page though.

The Spec-Up-T code itself is available [on Github](https://github.com/trustoverip/spec-up-t).

### Difference Between a Glossary and a Specification

A **glossary** is a collection of terms and their definitions, typically organized alphabetically. It provides clear explanations of key terms, jargon, or acronyms used within a specific context, such as a technical document, project, or industry. The primary purpose of a glossary is to ensure consistency and clarity by offering a shared understanding of terminology.

A **standardization specification**, on the other hand, is a detailed document that outlines the requirements, standards, or functionality of a system, product, or process. Specifications define what needs to be built, how it should perform, and often include technical details, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Their focus is on actionable details that guide development, testing, and implementation.

### How They Relate

A glossary supports a specification by defining the terms used within it, reducing ambiguity and misinterpretation. For example, if a specification uses terms like "API," "latency," or "data integrity," the glossary provides precise definitions to ensure all stakeholders understand these terms uniformly. In this way, a glossary complements the specification, serving as a foundational reference to enhance its clarity and usability.

An example **glossary** is the [Main TrustoverIP glossary](https://github.com/trustoverip/ctwg-main-glossary)

An example **standardization specification** is the [DID:Webs specification](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-did-method-webs-specification)

:::tip

If you aren't contributing to an existing Spec-Up-T project and want to create one yourself, you have several options:

- **Local installation**: Go to the [installation section](../getting-started/local-installation/installation.md) for full command-line control
- **GitHub web-based**: Use GitHub Actions workflows without installing anything locally
- **Spec-Up-T Editor**: 🌐 [Launch the web editor](https://blockchainbird.org/spec-up-t-web-editor/) or read the [user guide](../getting-started/spec-up-t-editor/user-guide) for a streamlined editing experience

If you are contributing to an existing project, you can edit files using GitHub's built-in web editor, the Spec-Up-T Editor, or any local text editor.
